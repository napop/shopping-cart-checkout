The goal of this exercise is to build a “Purchase Summary” user interface using React. 
1 Key UI element:
  o	The “Pickup saving” tooltip
  o	The “See Item detail” expander
  o	The “Apply Promo code” expander
2 The user should be able to enter a promo code “DISCOUNT” and on applying it, see a 10% discount reflect in the purchase summary. Use Redux for this.
3 Please refrain from using existing react components out there to help building this. For the pricing data, you can hard code it to an object/json and read from it.
4 Reusability of component is a key factor to consider. You’ll be evaluated based on code correctness and quality.
